# Self-Custody Resources
The moral of the story is to stop trusting these parasitic corrupt institutions with your hard earned money. There is a way to transact without having to ask anyone for permission and without having to trust anyone not to steal your money and give it to psychotic politicians that are using your own money to devise ways to kill you. Here are a few great resources from different content creators who have generated tutorials, videos, and guides in pain-staking detail to help you get started with self-custody.
